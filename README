Welcome to Lumen!

Lumen is (or will be someday) a GUI toolkit for Ada.

These are some simple demo programs that use Lumen, and (we hope) demonstrate
how some of its services are used.

The docs should be available here:

   http://www.niestu.com/software/lumen/

Enjoy, and visit the public git repository at either of these two places:

   git://ftp.niestu.com/lumen-demos
   https://github.com/karakalo/lumen-demos

The actual Lumen library, which was recently split off from the demos, is here:
